# Course materials for teaching and learning about reproducible research #

This site contains course materials for teaching and learning about reproducible research (especially in the social sciences). The initial version of this course is a one-day seminar at the Interacting Minds Centre (IMC) at Aarhus University on October 28, 2014.

The IMC short course involves a morning lecture and an afternoon hands-on session. Slides for both parts of the course and materials for the afternoon activities will be available here shortly.
