# Course materials for teaching and learning about reproducible research #

This site contains course materials for teaching and learning about reproducible research (especially in the social sciences). The initial version of this course is a one-day seminar at the Interacting Minds Centre (IMC) at Aarhus University on October 28, 2014. Event details are avilable [here](http://interactingminds.au.dk/events/single-events/artikel/reproducible-research-what-why-and-how/).

The IMC short course involves a morning lecture and an afternoon hands-on session. Slides for both parts of the course and materials for the afternoon activities will be available here shortly. 

## Reproducible Research: What, Why, and How? (Morning Session) ##

In this session, we will discuss reproducible research from the dual perspectives of simplifying one's research work and forwarding the multi-disciplinary push for #openscience. It will lay out why reproducible science matters and how to achieve it.

## Creating a Reproducible Scientific Workflow with R, LaTeX, and knitr (Afternoon Session) ##

The afternoon session applies the principles from the morning talk using a concrete set of tools, namely statistical analyses in R and document markup in LaTeX. The emphasis will be on knitr, an R package that seamlessly blends these tools to enable automated article generation and a greatly simplified scientific workflow. Participants will leave with a thorough understanding of knitr's capabilities and strategies for how to use R, LaTeX, and knitr to produce reproducible analyses, papers, and presentations. Exercises will help participants understand various advanced features of knitr and apply those techniques in their own scientific workflow. Basic familiarity with R will be helpful but the lack thereof should not preclude participation; familiarity with LaTeX is helpful but not at all required.
