# knitr #

 - Why reproducibility?
   - "Collaboration with others, including your future self"
   - Collaboration: much easier to collaborate when your work is reproducible
   - Future you: much easier to remember what you did and update when your work is reproducible
   - The scientific community: much easier to have others reproduce or replicate your work, giving your work credibility
   
 - Comparison of workflows
   - Traditional workflow
   - Reproducible workflow
     - Not actually a single workflow
     - Multiple ways to be reproducible
     - We'll work through a few, but there are many others
