# Reproducible Research #

 - Why reproducible research?
   - External reasons
     - Philosophical perspective
     - Second "Credibility Revolution" (transparency)
     - "Replication crisis"
     - Journals increasingly requiring it
     - Funding agencies require open science
   
   - Internal reasons
     - Greater confidence in own work
     - Easier scientific workflow
     - Easier collaboration
       - "Collaboration with others, including your future self"
       - Future you: much easier to remember what you did and update when your work is reproducible
   
   - Why reproducibility?
   
   
 - Why isn't science reproducible already?
   - Human behavior
     - Norms and traditions
     - Laziness
     - Cost
     - Difficulty
     - Disciplinary differences
     
   - Technology
     - Tools for reproducibility don't exist
     - No uniform standards for reproducible results
     - Different tools (OS, software, etc.)
     - Technology changes
     
 
 
 - What makes research reproducible?
   - No clear definition
     - Difficult to say
     - Depends on discipline-specific norms and standards
     - Evolving
     - Will always evolve as technology and research methods change
   - Discipline-specific examples
     - AAPOR standards
     - APSA
     - Psych Science
     - OSF
     - American Anthropological Association
     - CONSORT
   - Easier to define in the negative
     - What makes research *not* reproducible?
   - Examples
     - Methods aren't transparent
     - Data aren't available
     - 
     
 - Comparison of workflows
   - Traditional workflow
     - Design a study
     - Implement the study
     - Get data back
     - Do stuff to data (or RA does stuff to data)
     - Analyze data
     - Copy results into Excel or Word
     - Write results
     - Try to publish
     - Go back to software and reanalyze
     - Recopy results into Excel or Word
     - Try to publish, again
     - Once published, zip directory and forget
   - Reproducible workflow
     - Not actually a single workflow
     - Multiple ways to be reproducible
     - Basic premise:
       - From inputs, get outputs
       - Automated as much as possible
       - Easier to make changes, collaborate, share, be transparent, and reuse
     

 - What are the pieces of a reproducible research product?
   - Caveat emptor
     - Discipline-specific meaning
     - What makes research reproducible varies and will vary
   - First generation (past)
     - Documented data collection procedures
     - Documented data analytic methods
     - Well-described data (descriptives, etc.)
     - Closed data
     - Closed analysis
     - Proprietary software
     - Paywalled publication
   - Second generation (present)
     - Publicly archived research protocol
     - Publication includes more details
       - Summary protocol
       - Documentation of protocol violations
       - Data-related appendices
     - Increasingly shared data
     - Expectation of shared "replication files"
     - Mix of propriety and open software
     - Paywalled publication with "green" open access or working paper archives
   - Emerging trends
     - Persistently archived, open-licensed, documented data
       - Three S's: Structured, Simple, Semantic data
       - Codebooks, metadata, and documentation
     - Study preregistration
     - Publications with literate programming
       - knitr, which we'll talk about this afternoon
     - Open lab notebooks
       - Version-controlled research
     - Open-access publication
 

 
 
 - Reproducibility as part of open science
   - Data archiving
     - ICPSR
     - Dataverse
     - Figshare
   - Data citation
     - Emerging consensus
     - UNF
   - Open protocols
     - OSF
     - Wet sciences
   - Open materials
     - OSF
     - Not common elsewhere
       - Cite my own examples
   - Open data and code with reproducible analyses
     - "Literate programming"
     - Publication as an automated product of a software workflow
   - Methodological transparency
   - Open source software
     - R, Python, Octave, Julia
   - Open access publishing
 
 - Conclusion
   - Reproducible research is something you should do for yourself
   - If everyone's work is reproducible, science is better off
   - If everyone's work is reproducible, society has the potential to get more from science
