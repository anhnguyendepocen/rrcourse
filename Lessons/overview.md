# Reproducible Research #

 - Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic
 - Reproducibility, Replication, 
 
 - Why isn't science reproducible?
   - Human behavior
     - Norms and traditions
     - Laziness
     - Cost
     - Difficulty
     - Disciplinary differences
     
   - Technology
     - Tools for reproducibility don't exist
     - No uniform standards for reproducible results
     - Different tools (OS, software, etc.)
     - Technology changes
     
 
 - Open science
   - Data archiving
   - Data citation
   - Open protocols
   - Open materials
   - Open data and code
   - Reproducible analyses
     - "Literate programming"
   - Methodological transparency
   - Open source software
   - Open access publishing
 
 - Discipline-specific meaning
 
 
 - Why reproducibility?
   - "Collaboration with others, including your future self"
   - Collaboration: much easier to collaborate when your work is reproducible
   - Future you: much easier to remember what you did and update when your work is reproducible
   - The scientific community: much easier to have others reproduce or replicate your work, giving your work credibility
   
 - Comparison of workflows
   - Traditional workflow
   - Reproducible workflow
     - Not actually a single workflow
     - Multiple ways to be reproducible
     - We'll work through a few, but there are many others
